**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**
The frontend development for this project was developed using all of the elements listed above. With JavaScript and Express and using routes and controllers to handle requests from the browser, navigation was possible in a single-page application. This is also made possible through the use of Express to generate the initial static HTML webpage and handlebar templates to load additional data from the database. Through combining these tools, a functional SPA was created. 

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**
The use of a NoSQL MongoDB database was essential due its quick nature. In addition, the documents within MongoDB were already well formatted for use due to the use of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**
Javascript is a programming language. JSON is a data format, independent from any particular programming language. JSON is lightweight and is used for storing and transporting data capable for use in multiple programming languages. RESTful APIs can use JSON to receive requests and send responses, as seen in this application. 

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**
The prime example that comes to mind is utilizing handlebars to replace the static HTML pages with templates that allow for a functioning SPA. 

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**
When considering a full stack application, methods refers to the functions that drive the webpage such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. Endpoints are components of the application that can be used to return data to the client. Security is a layer of code necessary to prevent the unauthorized access of areas of the application. 

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
While I ran into areas of issue in this course, primarily ones that were out of my control such as my hard drive crashing in week 6 and setting me back a week and a half, this course is, in my opinion, one of the most important that I have taken so far while at SNHU. Coming into this degree program, I have had the goal of building my skills so that I could become a full stack developer. While I feel I still have a long way to go, and if given the opportunity to do it again, I would try to double the amount of time I was able to set aside each day to study, this course has taught me more than I had imagined. The integration of frontend and backend into a single application was brand new to me in this course. In addition, SPA developement was also new to me. While I am no where near where I would like to be in terms of skills, I hope that what I have learned here serves me well moving forward.
